# DreamBlend

DreamBlend is an expo app I created in React Native which allows users to take a picture of an object. Using image recognition Google Vision identifies what the image is of. The user can then apply a modifier and an image style and generate a new set of images based on the data. The app was built in React Native using Google Vision and Deep AI for image generation.

See below for examples of the crazy outcomes:
